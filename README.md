python3 game.py
```

## How to play

The game is to get the cannonball into the goal. The goal is located on the top in the middle (green rectangle). Before you shoot the cannonball you can draw lines, by right-clicking with your mouse and drag, or rectangles by left-clicking with your mouse and drag. This is meant to help you navigate the cannonball into the goal.

When you have drawn all obstacles you aim the cannon and then you press 'z' to shoot the cannonball. Don't worry you can still draw obstacles after the cannonball has been shot but beware! If for some reason you draw a rectangle and trap the ball inside there is no way of winning. Then you have to restart the game. To restart the game you simply press 'r'.

When the game has been won or lost you see either a green check sign (WIN) or a red cross (LOSS). Now you can start drawing obstacles again and when you've done that you can shoot the cannonball.
